\subsection*{Problem 1 - Group / Field theory}
Given $B = \{1,0\}$ and the operation $\oplus$ (described in homework2.pdf), does $B$ and $\oplus$ satisfy group properties?
\newline
\newline
Given the description of operation $\oplus$, we can conclude that  $\oplus \equiv (a + b) \pmod 7$ where $a,b \in B$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Closure, its trivial to verify that any $a \oplus b \in B$
    \item Associativity, it is trivial to verify that $(1 * 1) * 0 = 1 * (1 * 0)$
    \item Identity element, it is easy to identify 1 as the identity element
    \item Inverse element, there exists no inverse element for $1$, $1 * 0 = 0 * 1 =! 1$
\end{enumerate}

We are able to conclude that B is not a group
